# openshift-install-checklists

Some handy checklists to use when installing OpenShift or OKD.

These are a constant WIP.  As new versions of OpenShift/OKD are released, requirement may change slightly.  Always defer to official documentation.  Do send PRs if you can though to keep this up to date!

I recommend copying the checklist you want to a [github gist](https://gist.github.com/), which will allow you to quickly and easily check and uncheck the boxes as you complete items.
